# Tips
realm-browser-osx/RealmBrowser/Support/RLMModelExporter.m has code to export all models. Use that for inspiration.

/src/tests/models has two js model files used to generate realm files that can be opened by the browser and exported. The language subdirectories contains the expected output to compare to. (currently it's the output generated by the OSX Browser, but it has to be slightly updated, to match the format the new generator outputs). You can use that almost as a spec for what to generate. But do check the docs for the languages. 

Models:
linkingObjects and default values are NOT stored in Realm files.


# TODO
- Add comment to generated files that linkingObjects and       default values are not represented in the models.
- Add CS generator
- Add ObjC generator
- Add Java generator

Swift
  types of an array: can they not be optional? (see https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#property-cheatsheet)
